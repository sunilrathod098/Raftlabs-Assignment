# Raftlabs-Assignment


## Node Developer Intern Test

- The goal of this assessment is to assess your ability to build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js, your proficiency in using data structures and algorithms to efficiently manage and manipulate data, your ability to use TypeScript to write maintainable and scalable code, and your ability to use GraphQL and Hasura to build efficient and powerful APIs.
- Please read the entire document carefully before starting the assessment.

### Project Definition

- Build a RESTful API using Node.js and Express.js that serves data to a frontend application. The API should have the following features:

- 1. User registration and login with secure password storage and hashing.
- 2. CRUD functionality for managing data in a database.
- 3. The ability to search and filter data based on user-defined parameters.
- 4. Pagination and sorting of data.
- 5. Authentication and authorization of requests using JWT tokens.
- 6. Error handling and logging of API requests and responses.

- For the database, you can use any relational or non-relational database such as MySQL, MongoDB, or PostgreSQL.
- To implement these features efficiently, you should use appropriate data structures and algorithms on the backend. For example, you could use a hash table to store user information and a binary search tree to efficiently search for specific data.
- You should also use TypeScript to build the API. TypeScript is a typed superset of
- JavaScript that helps catch errors at compile-time, making the code more maintainable and reducing bugs. Using a Node.js framework like Nest.js or LoopBack will yield extra credits. You can use the modules and components provided by these frameworks to build a more structured and scalable API.
- Additionally, using Winston or a similar logging library to log errors and debug information will yield extra credits. For an extra challenge, you can integrate GraphQL into your API using a tool like Apollo Server or GraphQL Yoga. This will allow clients to query for specific data and reduce the number of requests needed to get the data they need. You can also use Hasura, which is an open-source engine that provides instant GraphQL APIs on your data sources, with granular access control, and without writing any code.

- Once you have completed the project, please do the following:
- 1. Share the link to the `git repository` where you have stored your code. Make sure the repository is public and accessible to us.
- 2. Share a walk-through video of the API. You can use Loom, Vimeo, or something similar to record the video. In the video, please demonstrate the functionality of the API and explain the code you have written.
